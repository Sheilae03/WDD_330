    <h3>Validating Forms</h3>
    <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, <br>
        and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. </p>
    <h5>Client-side validation</h5>
    <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. </p>
    <p>There are two different types of client-side validation</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in form validation(uses HTML5)</li>
        <li>JavaScript validation </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.<br>
    **The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax()<br>
</p>
<h5>Fetch method</h5>
<p>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings</p>
