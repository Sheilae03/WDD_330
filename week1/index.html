    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>

    <h5>HTML (TAGS)</h5>
    <p>
        Tags go into the (body) 
        <br>
        *input tags(a user can input their information)
        <br>
        *text area (input for large text)
        <br>
        *header tag
    </p>
    <h5>Java Script</h5>
    <p>
        *This is where our functions are placed. Math functions are used in Java Script.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile First Creation</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Start small and build up</li>
        <li>Cuts down on steps</li>
        <li>Reachability matters</li>
        <li>Speed matters</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Primary Control</h5>
<p>When creating an app, make sure you put the nav bar at
    the bottom of the screen, so it is reachable. Placement 
    matters.
</p>
<p>*If you put a box around the Menu, you will get more clicks.
<br>
*Creating moblie first forces simplicity
<br>
*Use placeholders and not labels before the box to save on 
space. After input placed move the placeholder to the top of
the box so the client can see what information was needed vs
what they inputed in.
<br>
*Enable the auto complete to help the forms be filled out faster.
</p>

    <h5>Passwords Matter</h5>
<p>
    *masking the password does not help, make sure to give the option
    to mask or see the password.
</p>
    <h5>Numbers Matter</h5>
<p>
    *Credit care should be spaced out and automaticly move to the next
    space for more #'s
    <br>
    *Bring up the # pad and not the full keyboard when you are asking for
    #'s to be inputed
</p>
    <h5>Calls Matter</h5>
<p>
    *always use an anchor tag to make the # callable
</p>
