    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>

    <h5>Errors</h5>
    <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>Exceptions</h5>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Stack Traces</h5>
    <p>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.<br>
     It is often not just a single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred <br>
     to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Warnings</h5>
    <p>A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.<br>
     This might sound good, but it can be problematic. The warning is letting you know that the program is not running correctly.</p>
     <br>
     <h5>Warnings and expections may present themselves differently depending on the browser being used.</h5>
     <br>
     <h5>Strict Mode</h5>
     <p> strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This is to help the programmer to now be slopping in the coding.<br>
    And to help there not be future problem with sloppy coding. You must put at the top of the js file to use strict mode.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Debugging the Browser</h5>
    <p>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it <br>
    originated, so you will need to run through the program to see what is happening at different stages of its execution. When doing this, it can be useful to create<br>
    what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the program.</p>
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Alert()-The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked,<br>
            it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they are what we expect them to be. </li>
        <li>console.log()- This can be used to log the variables in different stages of the program.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Error Objects</h5>
    <p>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.
        <br> Here is a list of 7 more error objects.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
        <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
        <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that does not exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
        <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there is an error in the codes syntax.</li>
        <li>TypeError is thrown when there is an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
        <li>URIError is thrown when there is a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
        <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Exception Handling</h5>
    <p>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production, however, it will<br>
     appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well on a ninja programmer.</p>
     <br>
     <h5>Tests/Test-driven Development</h5>
     <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops,<br>
     and any errors will be identified early on.<br>
    TDD stands for Test-driven Development. This a a step by step process.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>Refactor the code</li>
        <li>Test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
    </ul>
